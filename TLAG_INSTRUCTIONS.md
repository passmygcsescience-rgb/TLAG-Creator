# GEMS TLAG Lesson Generation Instructions

## 1. What is TLAG? (The Core Logic)

- **Foundation:** Based on cognitive science (Willingham), ensuring learning moves from Attention → Working Memory → Long Term Memory
- **Mechanism:** Uses specific routines ("GEMS Essentials") and standardized icons to reduce extraneous cognitive load
- **Goal:** Build well-organized schemas and ensure knowledge retention over time

## 2. The Non-Negotiable 6-Step Sequence

### Step 1: Do Now (Retrieval Practice)
- Generate 3-5 retrieval questions
- **Rule A:** Focus on PREVIOUSLY learned material (prior lessons/units) - strengthens retention
- **Rule B:** Do NOT introduce new lesson content here
- **Rule C:** Mix of free recall ("List...") and cued recall (fill-in-the-blank)

### Step 2: Learning Outcome
- Generate ONE single, precise outcome
- **Rule A:** Must describe a skill/procedural knowledge (e.g., "Calculate the rate...")
- **Rule B:** Do NOT differentiate (no "All/Most/Some") - all students aim for same outcome

### Step 3: To Know (Substantive Knowledge)
- List essential facts/concepts needed to achieve the outcome
- Write as knowledge statements emphasizing substantive knowledge (the "know what")

### Step 4: I Do, We Do, You Do (Instructional Phase)

| Phase | Description | Technique |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **I Do** | Explicit teacher modelling with script/bullet points | Cold Call, Show Call |
| **We Do** | Guided practice with scaffolding (sentence starters) | Turn and Talk |
| **You Do** | Independent practice, scaffolding removed/faded | Build fluency |

### Step 5: Affirmative Checking (Feedback Loop)
- Insert checkpoint DURING the 'You Do' phase
- **Rule:** Active monitoring, NOT marking at the end
- **Script:** "Circulate now. Check specifically for [Common Misconception]. Provide real-time feedback."

### Step 6: Exit Ticket
- Generate final short task/question
- **Rule:** Must directly assess the Learning Outcome (Step 2)
- Test if the SKILL was applied, not just recall of facts

## 3. Formatting Rules

### Terminology (ALWAYS use these)
| ✅ Correct | ❌ Never Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Learning Outcome | Objective, Aim |
| To Know | Key Words, Vocabulary |

### Icons/Visuals
| Element | Icon |
|---------|------|
| Do Now | 🕰️ (Retrieval) |
| Learning Outcome | 🎯 (Target) |
| To Know | 🧠 (Brain/Book) |
| Affirmative Checking | ✔️ (Check/Tick) |
| Exit Ticket | 🎟️ (Ticket) |

### Differentiation
- Do NOT create separate outcomes
- Differentiate by: scaffolding in "We Do" or support tools in "You Do"

## 5. PowerPoint Generation Rules

1. Use template layouts with built-in headers
2. Inject content into placeholders (idx=1 for body)
3. Remove title placeholders ("Click to add title")
4. Position content at top=0.85 inches
5. Font: Arial 24pt
6. Colors: Red for answers, Blue for keywords, Green for final answers
7. Ensure content fits without overflow
